Don't sit on my writing-table: you'll break it.</p><p>HIGGINS [sulkily] Sorry.</p><p>He goes to the divan, stumbling into the fender and over the fire-irons on his way; extricating himself with muttered imprecations; and finishing his disastrous journey by throwing himself so impatiently on the divan that he almost breaks it. Mrs. Higgins looks at him, but controls herself and says nothing.</p><p>A long and painful pause ensues.</p><p>MRS. HIGGINS [at last, conversationally] Will it rain, do you think?</p><p>LIZA.
