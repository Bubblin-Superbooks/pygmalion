She's a credit to me, ain't she?</p><p>LIZA. I tell you, it's easy to clean up here. Hot and cold water on tap, just as much as you like, there is. Woolly towels, there is; and a towel horse so hot, it burns your fingers. Soft brushes to scrub yourself, and a wooden bowl of soap smelling like primroses. Now I know why ladies is so clean. Washing's a treat for them. Wish they saw what it is for the like of me!</p><p>HIGGINS. I'm glad the bath-room met with your approval.</p><p>LIZA. It didn't: not all of it; and I don't care who hears me say it. Mrs. Pearce knows.</p><p>HIGGINS. What was wrong, Mrs. Pearce?</p><p>MRS. PEARCE [blandly] Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter.</p></div> </div>
