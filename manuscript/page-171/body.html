Isn't she, Mr. Doolittle?</p><p>DOOLITTLE. Very tender-hearted, ma'am. Takes after me.</p><p>MRS. HIGGINS. Just so. She had become attached to you both. She worked very hard for you, Henry! I don't think you quite realize what anything in the nature of brain work means to a girl like that. Well, it seems that when the great day of trial came, and she did this wonderful thing for you without making a single mistake, you two sat there and never said a word to her, but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole thing. And then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you! <em>I</em> should have thrown the fire-irons at you.</p></div> </div>
