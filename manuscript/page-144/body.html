By the time she gets there she is on the point of screaming. She sits down in Higgins's chair and holds on hard to the arms. Finally she gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging.</p><p>HIGGINS [in despairing wrath outside] What the devil have I done with my slippers? [He appears at the door].</p><p>LIZA [snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him one after the other with all her force] There are your slippers. And there. Take your slippers; and may you never have a day's luck with them!</p><p>HIGGINS [astounded] What on earth—! [He comes to her]. What's the matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?</p><p>LIZA [breathless] Nothing wrong—with YOU. I've won your bet for you, haven't I? That's enough for you. <em>I</em> don't matter, I suppose.</p></div> </div>
