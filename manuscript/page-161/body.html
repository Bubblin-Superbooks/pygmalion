He is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable frock-coat, with white waistcoat and grey trousers. A flower in his buttonhole, a dazzling silk hat, and patent leather shoes complete the effect. He is too concerned with the business he has come on to notice Mrs. Higgins. He walks straight to Higgins, and accosts him with vehement reproach.</p><p>DOOLITTLE [indicating his own person] See here! Do you see this? You done this.</p><p>HIGGINS. Done what, man?</p><p>DOOLITTLE. This, I tell you. Look at it. Look at this hat. Look at this coat.</p><p>PICKERING. Has Eliza been buying you clothes?</p><p>DOOLITTLE. Eliza! not she. Not half. Why would she buy me clothes?</p></div> </div>
