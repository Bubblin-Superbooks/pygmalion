You shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day. You shall live on them. Eh?</p><p>LIZA [who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked by it] I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out of my mouth.</p><p>HIGGINS. Listen, Eliza. I think you said you came in a taxi.</p><p>LIZA. Well, what if I did? I've as good a right to take a taxi as anyone else.</p><p>HIGGINS. You have, Eliza; and in future you shall have as many taxis as you want. You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every day. Think of that, Eliza.</p><p>MRS. PEARCE. Mr. Higgins: you're tempting the girl. It's not right. She should think of the future.</p></div> </div>
