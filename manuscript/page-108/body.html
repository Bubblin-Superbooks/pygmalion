That's a good boy. Now tell me about the girl.</p><p>HIGGINS. She's coming to see you.</p><p>MRS. HIGGINS. I don't remember asking her.</p><p>HIGGINS. You didn't. I asked her. If you'd known her you wouldn't have asked her.</p><p>MRS. HIGGINS. Indeed! Why?</p><p>HIGGINS. Well, it's like this. She's a common flower girl. I picked her off the kerbstone.</p><p>MRS. HIGGINS. And invited her to my at-home!</p><p>HIGGINS [rising and coming to her to coax her] Oh, that'll be all right. I've taught her to speak properly; and she has strict orders as to her behavior. She's to keep to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health—Fine day and How do you do, you know—and not to let herself go on things in general. That will be safe.</p></div> </div>
