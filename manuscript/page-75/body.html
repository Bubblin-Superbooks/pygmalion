I'm always particular about what I say. Why do you say this to me?</p><p>MRS. PEARCE [unmoved] No, sir: you're not at all particular when you've mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn't matter before me: I'm used to it. But you really must not swear before the girl.</p><p>HIGGINS [indignantly] I swear! [Most emphatically] I never swear. I detest the habit. What the devil do you mean?</p><p>MRS. PEARCE [stolidly] That's what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal too much. I don't mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil and where the devil and who the devilâ€”</p><p>HIGGINS. Really! Mrs. Pearce: this language from your lips!</p></div> </div>
